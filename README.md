## Overview

This repository contains the implementation and optimization efforts of the
Simplified Sense Word Disambiguation (WSD) algorithm written in C++ as part of
UVic's CSC485C course project. This project belongs to:
[Ahmed Siddiqui](mailto:jesuisahmedn@gmail.com) and
[Jordan Kirchner](mailto:JordanKirchner04@hotmail.com)

## Implementation

The algorithm implementated is based on the simplified version of
[Michael Lesk's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesk_algorithm#Simplified_Lesk_algorithm)
devised in 1986.
