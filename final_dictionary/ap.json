act of judgment esteem is an act of valuing or prizing and when applied to individuals denotes a sentiment of moral approbation See Estimate Appreciate lies between the two As compared with estimate it supposes a union of sensibility with judgment producing a nice and delicate perception As compared with esteem it denotes a valuation of things according to their appropriate and distinctive excellence and not simply their moral worth Thus with reference to the former of these delicate perception an able writer says Women have a truer appreciation of character than men and another remarks It is difficult to appreciate the true force and distinctive sense of terms which we are every day using So also we speak of the difference between two things as sometimes hardly appreciable With reference to the latter of these that of valuation as the result of a nice perception we say It requires a peculiar cast of character to appreciate the poetry of Wordsworth He who has no delicacy himself can not appreciate it in others The thought of death is salutary because it leads us to appreciate worldly things aright Appreciate is much used in cases where something is in danger of being overlooked or undervalued as when we speak of appreciating the difficulties of a subject or the risk of an undertaking So Lord Plunket referring to an ominous silence which prevailed among the Irish peasantry says If you knew now to appreciate that silence it is more formidable than the most clamorous opposition In like manner a person who asks some favor of another is apt to say I trust you will appreciate my motives in this request Here we have the key to a very frequent use of the word It is hardly necessary to say that appreciate looks on the favorable side of things we never speak of
