The verb to be except in a few rare case like that of Shakespeare s To be or not to be is used simply as a copula to connect a subject with its predicate as man is mortal the soul is immortal The verb to exist is never properly used as a mere copula but points to things that stand forth or have a substantive being as when the soul is freed from all corporeal alliance then it truly exists It is not therefore properly synonymous with to be when used as a copula though occasionally made so by some writers for the sake of variety as in the phrase there exists is no reason for laying new taxes We may indeed say a friendship has long existed between them instead of saying there has long been a friendship between them but in this case exist is not a mere copula It is used in its appropriate sense to mark the friendship as having been long in existence A prefix originally the same word as by joined with verbs it serves a To intensify the meaning as bespatter bestir b To render an
