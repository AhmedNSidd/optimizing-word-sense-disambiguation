divisible into three parts the external ear which includes the pinna or auricle and meatus or external opening the middle ear drum or tympanum and the internal ear or labyrinth The middle ear is a cavity connected by the Eustachian tube with the pharynx separated from the opening of the external ear by the tympanic membrane and containing a chain of three small bones or ossicles named malleus incus and stapes which connect this membrane with the internal ear The essential part of the internal ear where the fibers of the auditory nerve terminate is the membranous labyrinth a complicated system of sacs and tubes filled with a fluid the endolymph and lodged in a cavity called the bony labyrinth in the periotic bone The membranous labyrinth does not completely fill the bony labyrinth but is partially suspended in it in a fluid the perilymph The bony labyrinth consists of a central cavity the vestibule into which three semicircular canals and the canal of the cochlea spirally coiled in mammals open The vestibular portion of the membranous labyrinth consists of two sacs the utriculus and sacculus connected by a narrow tube into the former of which three membranous semicircular canals open while the latter is connected with a membranous tube in the cochlea containing the organ of Corti By the help of the external ear the sonorous vibrations of the air are concentrated upon the tympanic membrane and set it vibrating the chain of bones in the middle ear transmits these vibrations to the internal ear where they cause certain delicate structures in the
