iron Fairholt A game at cards derived from brag and first played about 1835 in the Southwestern United States Johnson s Cyc Note A poker hand is played with a poker deck composed of fifty two cards of thirteeen values each card value being represented once in each of four suits namely spades hearts diamonds and clubs The game is played in many variations but almost invariably the stage of decision as to who wins occurs when each player has five cards or chooses five cards from some larger number available to him The winner usually is the player with the highest valued hand but in some variations the winner may be the player with the lowest valued hand The value of a hand is ranked by hand types representing the relationships of the cards to each other The hand types are ranked by the probability of receiving such a hand when dealt five cards Within each hand type the value is also ranked by the values of the cards The hand types are labeled in decreasing value five of a kind royal flush straight flush four of a kind full house coll full boat or boat flush straight three of a kind two pairs one pair and when the contending players have no hands of any of the above types the player with the highest valued card wins if there is a tie the next highest valued card of the tied players determines the winner and so on If two players have the same type of hand the value of

reflected from a plate of unsilvered glass at an angle of about 56 be received upon a second plate of glass similar to the former and at the same angle of incidence the light will be readily reflected when the two planes of incidence are parallel to each other but will not be reflected when the two planes of incidence are perpendicular to each other The light has therefore acquired new properties by reflection from the first plate of glass and is called polarized light while the modification which the light has experienced by this reflection is called polarization The plane in which the beam of light is reflected from the first mirror is called the plane of polarization The angle of polarization is the angle at which a beam of light must be reflected in order that the polarization may be the most complete The term polarization was derived from the theory of emission and it was conceived that each luminous molecule has two poles analogous to the poles of a magnet but this view is not now held According to the undulatory theory ordinary light is produced by vibrations transverse or perpendicular to the direction of the ray and distributed as to show no distinction as to any particular direction But when by any means these vibrations are made to take place in one plane the light is said to be plane polarized If only a portion of the vibrations lie in one plane the ray is said to be partially polarized Light may be polarized by several methods other than by reflection as by refraction through most crystalline media or by being transmitted obliquely through several plates of glass with parallel faces If a beam of polarized light be transmitted through a crystal of quartz in the direction of its axis the plane of polarization will be changed by an angle proportional to the thickness of the crystal This phenomenon is called rotatory polarization A beam of light reflected from a metallic surface or from glass surfaces under certain peculiar conditions acquires properties still more complex its vibrations being no longer rectilinear but circular or elliptical This phenomenon is called circular or elliptical polarization","Elec An effect produced
